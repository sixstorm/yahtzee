    - On first roll, all die are new/random.  User can click aligned button to "hold" die until after roll 3.
    - On second roll, unheld die are changed.  User can click aligned button to "hold" die until after roll 3.
    - On third roll, user must choose scoring category with current dice.
    - Once scoring category is chosen, total score is updated and flow is restarted.
    - 'isGameOver' is false, but true when all scoring categories are fulfilled.
