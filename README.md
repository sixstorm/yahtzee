Just some fun with HTML5/CSS3/Javascript!

Still To Do:

- Basic game logic
  - Code is there to detect different scoring methods, just not the actual "flow" of the game or even a simple round of rolling dice.
- Dice selection - How to hold dice until roll 3 when you must choose a score.
- CSS layout - Try to find something easy, yet pleasing to the eye.
- Scoreboard
- Animations
- Email/Telegram Integration - Let me know when you finish a game via Email or Telegram Bot
